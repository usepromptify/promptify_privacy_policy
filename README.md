# Promptify Chrome Extension Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** September 1, 2025

I respect and value your privacy. This Privacy Policy describes how I handle and protect your personal information in relation to your use of the Promptify Chrome Extension.

## Information Collection

The Promptify Chrome Extension collects and stores the following information locally on your device:

- **API Keys:** Your Google Gemini API key is stored locally to enable prompt enhancement functionality
- **User Preferences:** Settings such as enhancement engine mode, refinement iterations, and keyboard shortcuts
- **Custom Engine Data:** Any custom enhancement engines you create, including their names, descriptions, and system prompts

**Important:** No personal information is transmitted to me or any third parties. All data is stored locally in your browser and is used solely for the extension's functionality.

## Data Usage

The information collected is used exclusively to:

- Authenticate with Google's Gemini API to enhance your prompts
- Maintain your preferred settings across browser sessions
- Enable cross-domain functionality so your settings work across different AI platforms

Your selected text and prompts are sent only to Google's Gemini API for processing and enhancement. I do not have access to, store, or process any of your prompts or enhanced content.

## Data Storage

All extension data is stored locally using:

- Browser localStorage (when available)
- Cross-domain storage methods for compatibility across AI platforms
- No data is stored on external servers or transmitted to third parties

## Third-Party Services

This extension communicates with:

- **Google Gemini API** (`generativelanguage.googleapis.com`) - for prompt enhancement processing
- **Google AI Studio** (linked for API key generation) - external website not controlled by this extension

The extension does not integrate with any other third-party services.

## Data Sharing

I do not collect, store, sell, or share any of your personal information or usage data. Your API key and settings remain entirely on your device and are never transmitted to me.

## Security

Your data security is important. The extension:

- Stores all sensitive data locally on your device
- Uses secure HTTPS connections for all API communications
- Does not transmit personal information to unauthorized parties

## Changes to this Privacy Policy

I reserve the right to update this Privacy Policy at any time. Any changes will be effective immediately upon posting the revised Privacy Policy. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.

By using the Promptify Chrome Extension, you signify your consent and agreement to the terms of this Privacy Policy.
